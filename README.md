GlassBox AI – Making AI Fair, Transparent & Accountable
Hey there! 
Welcome to the project repository for **GlassBox AI**, our finalist submission for **SAP HackFest 2025**. Out of over 4000 teams, we were proud to make it to the **Top 200 National Finalists**.

This repository showcases the **concept and design** behind GlassBox AI — an idea we developed to address one of the most pressing challenges in AI today: **bias and lack of transparency**. While no working prototype or code was required for this hackathon, our focus was on deeply understanding the problem and crafting a feasible, impactful solution.

What's the idea?
AI is being used in critical decisions — hiring, loans, recommendations — but many of these systems operate as black boxes. We don't always know how they work or whether they're fair.

**GlassBox AI** is our proposed solution to that problem. It aims to:
- Identify potential **bias** in datasets and machine learning models
- Provide **simple, understandable explanations** for AI predictions
- Help businesses adopt **ethical and transparent AI** with confidence

We built this idea with real-world business contexts in mind — where trust, fairness, and accountability are essential.

My Role:
As part of the core team, I was involved in:

- Brainstorming and defining the GlassBox AI concept
- Designing user journeys and outlining the fairness evaluation process
- Contributing to the slide decks and presenting the solution in the final business round

Recognition

- Selected as a **National Finalist** in **SAP HackFest 2025**
- Ranked among the **Top 200 teams out of 4000+** across India


This repository includes the three PPTs we submitted across the Design Thinking, Basic, and Business rounds — giving you a complete look at how our idea evolved during the hackathon.
Let me know if you’d like to explore this idea further or collaborate on turning it into a working prototype someday!
