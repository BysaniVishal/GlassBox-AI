#GlassBox AI – Making AI Fair, Transparent & Accountable

Hey there 👋  
Welcome to the project repository for **GlassBox AI**, our finalist submission for **SAP HackFest 2025**. Out of 4000+ teams, we were proud to make it to the Top 200 National Finalists.
This project is about building trust in AI systems by detecting bias, promoting fairness, and making AI decisions explainable — turning black-box models into transparent, glass-box systems.

 What's the idea?
AI plays a growing role in decision-making, but often it’s not clear how or why a decision was made. And sometimes, it's just not fair.
GlassBox AI is a concept that aims to:

- Identify potential bias in datasets and machine learning models
- Explain predictions in simple, understandable terms
- Help businesses evaluate and adopt ethical, responsible AI

We designed this for real-world use cases where trust and transparency are essential.

My role
I was actively involved in:
- Ideating the GlassBox AI solution and fairness detection process
- Mapping user journeys and designing the evaluation pipeline
- Preparing the business model and presenting during the final pitch
