GlassBox AI ‚Äì Making AI Fair, Transparent & Accountable

Hey there!
Welcome to the project repository for **GlassBox AI**, our finalist submission for **SAP HackFest 2025**. Out of 4000+ teams, we were proud to make it to the Top 200 National Finalists.
This project is about building trust in AI systems by detecting bias, promoting fairness, and making AI decisions explainable ‚Äî turning black-box models into transparent, glass-box systems.

 What's the idea?
AI plays a growing role in decision-making, but often it‚Äôs not clear how or why a decision was made. And sometimes, it's just not fair.
GlassBox AI is a concept that aims to:

- Identify potential bias in datasets and machine learning models
- Explain predictions in simple, understandable terms
- Help businesses evaluate and adopt ethical, responsible AI

We designed this for real-world use cases where trust and transparency are essential.

My role
I was actively involved in:
- Ideating the GlassBox AI solution and fairness detection process
- Mapping user journeys and designing the evaluation pipeline
- Preparing the business model and presenting during the final pitch
